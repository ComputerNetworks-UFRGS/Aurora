# Installing DHCP server for Aurora

You might want to install a DHCP server to auto-configure IP addresses for the virtual machines. Although it is not mandatory, somtimes might be helpful for your experiments. The configuration is the following:

# Install via apt-get

apt-get install isc-dhcp-server

# On /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf configure your network ranges

subnet 10.13.12.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
  range 10.13.12.50 10.13.12.250;
  option routers 10.13.12.23;
  option broadcast-address 10.13.12.255;
  default-lease-time 600;
  max-lease-time 7200;
}

# On /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server configure the interface to where the 
# DHCP server shoud run. IMPORTANT: Don't run DHCP server on eth0 on ANT!

INTERFACES="virbr1"

# The leases file will help you to find which virtual machine has which IP address

cat /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases
